         collect x)

(cl-loop for [k v] {:a 1, :b 2}
         collect k)
=> [:a :b]



Wilder examples:

(cl-loop for letters [:a :b :c :d :e :f]
         for whole-nums (iterate inc 1)
         set mults-of-10 (* 10 whole-nums)
         (if (odd? whole-nums)
           (if (odd? whole-nums)
             [collect letters]
             [collect mults-of-10])
           (if true
             (if (even? whole-nums)
               [collect mults-of-10]
               [collect letters]))))
=> [:a 20 :c 40 :e 60]
